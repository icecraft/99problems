-- Problem 93 
-- An arithmetic puzzle
{-
    Given a list of integer numbers, find a correct way of inserting arithmetic signs (operators) such that the result is a correct equation.
    [2,3,5,7,11] we can form the equations 2-3+5+7 = 11 or 2 = (3*5+7)/11

-- Generate K-regular simple graphs with N nodes
{-
    n a K-regular graph all nodes have a degree of K; i.e. the number of edges incident in each node is K. 
    How many (non-isomorphic!) 3-regular graphs with 6 nodes are there?
